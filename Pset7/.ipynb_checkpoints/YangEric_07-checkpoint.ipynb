There are significantly less p-values that meet Wiggins threshold of p-value < 0.05 in the merged 1 and 3 dataset compared to the two other merged combinations. While the statistical analyses is incomplete, from looking at the p-values alone, we can infer that the expression profiles in dataset 1 and dataset 3 are more similar to one another than each to dataset 3, suggesting that the samples in dataset 2 come from the mutant. Wiggins' procedure tells us that there are less significant different gene expression profiles between datasets 1 and 3 given the threshold.

    "I do not agree with Wiggins' conclusion that 2246 genes are differentially expressed in the wt vs mutant comparison. First, it is unclear why he selected 2246 instead of 2312 obtained by comparing datasets 1 and 3. But the bigger problem is that Wiggins did not correct for the multiple null hypotheses testing done by edgeR. Each p value in the output describes the probability we get a value as extreme given that there is no expression difference **for that gene**. As we have learned, if we apply a p-value threshold to all the tests, we often result in a lot of false positives simply due to chance, especially if the number of tests is high. There are many ways to correct for the multiple testing problem. Instead of lowering the p-value (Bonferroni) which is often times too stringent, edgeR adopts the more robust Benjamini-Hochberg procdure to account for the false discovery rate (FDR), which Wiggins failed to analyze. By accounting for the FDR, we are able to control the number of false positives we make out of all the hypotheses tested, more confidently concluding the number of genes that are truly differentially expressed."

    "Looking at Wiggins edgeR pipeline, it looks like Wiggins forgot to normalize for indirect effects on relative abundance. As we have learned in the course, RNA seq experiments give us relative abundances, which is a zero sum game. For example, let's say there are 2 genes A and B that are mapped and compared between an experimental condition and a control. If gene A is overexpressed in an experimental condition, and gene B expression from the experimental condition stays the same as gene B expression from the control, the relative abundance of gene B from the condition will be lower since it holds a lower proportion out of all the samples in the experimental condition, even though its absolute counts did not change compared to the control. If we do not account for this, we would mistakenly conclude that gene B is underexpressed in the experimental condition. EdgeR has a step called calcNormFactors that implements trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) to deal with this. EdgeR essentially \"trims\" the outliers and recalculates the means to figure out how much of this relative abundance shift occured and corrects for it. "
